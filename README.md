  Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using only NumPy, without the help of deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The neural network is trained on the classic Digit Recognizer dataset, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

Key Features:
Pure NumPy Implementation: No external deep learning frameworks are used, providing a foundational understanding of neural networks.
Training on Digit Recognizer Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset for recognizing handwritten digits (e.g., MNIST), commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks.
Backpropagation & Gradient Descent: Implements backpropagation and gradient descent for training the network.
Performance: Achieves an accuracy of 85%, showcasing the effectiveness of even simple neural networks when implemented correctly.
This project serves as an excellent introduction to the inner workings of neural networks, making it easier to grasp the math behind deep learning while working directly with the raw data.
